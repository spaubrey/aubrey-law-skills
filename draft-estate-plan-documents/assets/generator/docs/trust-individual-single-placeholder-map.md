## Review Notes

- The source document is Massachusetts-specific and for an unmarried individual grantor.
- The generated template preserves the firm form structure and replaces bracketed drafting fields with generator placeholders and conditional branches.
- `trust.display_date` renders `trust.date` when known and `________________, 20___` when the trust date is unknown.
- Legal text was preserved as source material where possible, but the generated template remains a draft automation template requiring Massachusetts attorney review before client use.
